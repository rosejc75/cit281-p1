## Welcome to Rose's Project 1!


### Folder Tree
In this project, I started by going into the terminal and creating a few different folders using commands I learned from Lab 1 Lab 2.

### Ping
I then used the ping command to determine if a "specific internet location is available" by sending out many internet data packets and waiting for a response. The ping is used to break out a command line operation.

### Day of Week
we then coded in VS code the day of the week of the current day. I did this by using an array that contained all the days of the week within it.

### Random Letters
Next, I coded to ouput a string of random lowercase letters
